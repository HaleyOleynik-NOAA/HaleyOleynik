### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

#### **Graduate Student and Research Assistant** (Sept. 2018 - July 2020)
*School of Marine Science and Policy, University of Delaware*

- Analyzed data from a long term trawl survey using multivariate statistical methods in R to explore changes in fish and invertebrate assemblages and overall community composition in Delaware Bay through time and identify physical and anthropogenic drivers of these changes

- Assisted in lab and field work including marine animal husbandry, stable isotope analysis of highly migratory marine species, and respirometry of pelagic predators

#### **Undergraduate Senior Honors Thesis** (Sept. 2014 - May 2015)
Title: *Change and Adaptation in the Maine Lobster Fishing Industry*
*Department of Sociology, Colby College*

- Designed and conducted research on the societal impacts of the shifting lobster population and subsequent management on the Lobster fishing industry in Maine

- Collected and analyzed quantitative and qualitative data to understand the social practices of the industry by focusing on the informal micro-level processes and perceptions of people situated at various points within the industry

#### **Research Intern**	(June 2014 - Aug 2014)
*CIEE Bonaire, Bonaire, Netherland Antilles*

- Used SCUBA field sampling methods to catch invasive lionfish species, Pterois, and observe behavioral patterns

- Dissected lionfish, assessed stomach contents, and analyzed results through Stata and Excel in order to explore the impact lionfish have on juvenile fish populations in Bonaire

#### **Independent Study: Sea Urchin Interaction** (Feb 2014 - May 2014)
*Department of Biology, Colby College*

- Analyzed and curated data from over 100 scientific papers on sea urchin ecology to create a database that would further knowledge of sea urchin, macroalgae, and coral interactions

#### **Research Intern**	(Jan 2013 - Feb 2013)
*Smithsonian Natural History Museum, Washington D.C.*

- Curated, identified, and photographed over 50 species of pteropoda to catalogue morphology for a new taxonomic database

- Used Geneious and Excel to collect and analyze data for research of the genetics, morphology, and biogeographic information of pteropods to better understand ocean connectivity

### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
